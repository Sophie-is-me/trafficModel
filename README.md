# Abstract
This is the traffic model built by Python.

The model is based on [Intelligent Driver Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_driver_model), and most of class' designs are referenced by volkhin's [RoadTrafficSimulator](https://github.com/volkhin/RoadTrafficSimulator) and movsim's [traffic-simulation-de](https://github.com/movsim/traffic-simulation-de).
# Operation
Double clicking on the grid can create intersection.

Press on the intersection and release on the non-intersection place can create the road.

Mouse wheel can zoom the area.

Mouse click and drag move the area.
# Known problem
So far the model haven't any problem. 

If notice some bugs, please generously report to me, thank you. 
# Outlook
Will add the multiple lane in single road and the multiple roads in single intersection function.

Will adjust the kernel of the trafficModel and add the signal control in the future.

May change the car moving mechanizm to auto-drive.
