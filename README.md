# Abstract
This is the traffic model built by Python.

The model is based on Intelligent Driver Model, and most of class design is referenced by volkhin's [RoadTrafficSimulator](https://github.com/volkhin/RoadTrafficSimulator).
# Operation
Double clicking on the grid can create intersection.

Press on the intersection and release on the non-intersection place can create the road.

Mouse wheel can zoom the area.

Mouse click and drag move the area.
# Outlook
Will adjust the kernel of the trafficModel and add the signal control in the future.
