# Abstract
This is the traffic model built by Python.

The model is based on [Intelligent Driver Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_driver_model), and most of class designs are referenced by volkhin's [RoadTrafficSimulator](https://github.com/volkhin/RoadTrafficSimulator) and movsim's [traffic-simulation-de](https://github.com/movsim/traffic-simulation-de).
# Operation
Double clicking on the grid can create intersection.

Press on the intersection and release on the non-intersection place can create the road.

Mouse wheel can zoom the area.

Mouse click and drag move the area.
# Known problem
Car turning trajetory problem.
Car turning mechanizm problem.
# Outlook
Will adjust the kernel of the trafficModel and add the signal control in the future.
